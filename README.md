A Flappy Bird simulation using neural networks and genetic algorithm

This project is for the 3rd week of **KAIST CS496 Immersion Camp: Intensive Programming and Startup.**

## Motivation
Not knowing a single thing about AI nor neural networks, we thought that it would be fun to implement neural networks from scratch and apply it to a simulation. This is the side project that we applied our neural networks library to. Check out [the main project](https://github.com/JumpingCar/JumpingCar) as well.

## About
The objective of this simulation is to generate units that play this clone of Flappy Bird for as long as it can. Every unit has its own neural network, making decisions on whether to jump or not on every frame
